In the classical algorithm, determining whether a function, $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$, is constant or balanced requires testing the function on a variety of different inputs; however, a classical algorithm can only check one input at a time, and in the worst case it must sample over half of all possible inputs which results in $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries. This is because even if all early outputs are the same, the function could still be balanced until a different value appears. Therefore, the classical approach scales exponentially with the input size.

The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm solves the same problem by using only one oracle query, regardless of the input size. By preparing the input qubits in a superposition of all $2^n$ possible inputs, the quantum circuit evaluates the function on every input simultaneously. Applying Hadamard gates later on causes the amplitudes to interfere which reveals whether the function is constant or balanced after just one measurement. As a result, combining superposition and interference together gives the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm an advantage over classical algorithms, reducing the query count from exponential to a constant.
